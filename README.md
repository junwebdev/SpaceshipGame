# SpaceShip Game Development Tutorial

## Introduction

Welcome to the SpaceShip Game Development Tutorial! In this comprehensive guide, we'll take you through the exciting journey of creating a 2D space-themed game using C# and the SplashKit graphics library. By following along, you'll gain a deep understanding of game development principles and techniques, empowering you to build your own captivating games.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your computer:

- **Visual Studio:** Download and install Visual Studio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for C# development. Choose the version compatible with your operating system from the [official website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
- **SplashKit:** Download and set up SplashKit, a cross-platform game development library for C#. Visit the [SplashKit website](https://www.splashkit.io/) to download the appropriate version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Installing Visual Studio

1. **Download Visual Studio:** Navigate to the [Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and select the version suitable for your operating system.
2. **Installation:** Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

### Installing SplashKit

2. **Setup:** Once downloaded, follow the provided installation instructions to set up SplashKit on your computer.

### Creating a New Project

1. **Open Visual Studio:** Launch Visual Studio after installation.
2. **Create New Project:** From the start page, select "Create a new project" or navigate to File > New > Project.
3. **Choose Project Type:** In the project templates window, select "Console App (.NET Core)" to create a basic console application.
4. **Name and Location:** Name your project "SpaceShipGame" and choose a location to save it.
5. **Create Project:** Click "Create" to generate your new project.

## Step 2: Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

### Classes and Objects

In C#, classes act as blueprints for creating objects, which represent real-world entities or concepts.

### Encapsulation and Abstraction

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (fields) and methods (functions) within a class to hide the internal state and expose only essential functionalities.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details of a class and exposing only essential features to the outside world.

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

- **Inheritance:** Allowing a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (base class), promoting code reuse and hierarchical relationships.
- **Polymorphism:** Enabling objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, facilitating flexible and extensible code.

## Step 3: Designing the Game Objects

Now that we've covered the basics of object-oriented programming, let's design the game objects for our SpaceShip game.

### Asteroid Class

The Asteroid class represents the asteroids that move across the game screen.

```csharp
// Asteroid.cs
using SplashKitSDK;

namespace SpaceShipGame
{
    public class Asteroid
    {
        // Properties, constructor, and methods here...
    }
}
```

### Bullet Class

The Bullet class represents the bullets fired by the player's spaceship.

```csharp
// Bullet.cs
using SplashKitSDK;

namespace SpaceShipGame
{
    public class Bullet
    {
        // Properties, constructor, and methods here...
    }
}
```

### SpaceShip Class

The SpaceShip class represents the player-controlled spaceship.

```csharp
// SpaceShip.cs
using SplashKitSDK;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace SpaceShipGame
{
    public class SpaceShip
    {
        // Properties, constructor, and methods here...
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Drawing Graphics

In this step, we'll focus on drawing graphics for our SpaceShip game using SplashKit.

### Loading Images

We'll utilize SplashKit to load bitmap images for various game elements such as the spaceship, asteroids, bullets, and background.

### Drawing Images

Next, we'll implement methods within each game object class to draw their respective images onto the game
window. We'll use SplashKit's drawing functions to render the bitmap images at their specified positions.

## Step 5: Handling User Input

In this step, we'll implement functionality to handle user input for controlling the spaceship and firing bullets in our SpaceShip game.

### Keyboard Input

We'll capture keyboard input to enable the player to control the movement of the spaceship. By implementing methods in the SpaceShip class to respond to keyboard events, we'll update the spaceship's position accordingly.

### Mouse Input

Additionally, we'll implement mouse input to allow the player to fire bullets using SplashKit's input handling functions. We'll utilize the mouse position to determine the direction in which the bullets should be fired from the spaceship.

## Step 6: Implementing Game Logic

Now that we have set up user input handling, it's time to implement the core game logic for our SpaceShip game. This step involves updating object positions, detecting collisions, and managing scoring and lives.

### Updating Object Positions

We'll write logic to update the positions of asteroids, bullets, and the spaceship in the Update method of the SpaceShipGame class. By calculating the new positions based on velocities, we'll ensure that the objects stay within the boundaries of the game window.

### Collision Detection

Implementing collision detection between game objects is crucial for handling interactions. We'll check for collisions between bullets and asteroids, as well as between the spaceship and asteroids. Upon collision, we'll update the game state accordingly by removing bullets and asteroids, updating the player's score, and decrementing lives if necessary.

### Scoring and Lives

Tracking the player's score and remaining lives within the SpaceShip class, we'll update these values based on game events such as collisions and successful hits on asteroids. By implementing robust game logic, we'll ensure an engaging and challenging gameplay experience for players!

## Step 7: Testing and Debugging

Testing and debugging are essential steps in the game development process to ensure that our game functions as expected and delivers a seamless experience to players.

### Testing

Before releasing our game, thorough testing is necessary to identify and fix any bugs or issues. We'll perform various types of testing, including:

- **Unit Testing:** Test individual components, such as classes and methods, to ensure they behave as intended.
- **Integration Testing:** Test how different components interact with each other to validate the overall system behavior.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involve potential end-users to evaluate the game's usability and provide feedback.

### Debugging

During testing, we'll likely encounter bugs or unexpected behavior in our code. Debugging involves identifying and fixing these issues systematically. We'll use debugging tools provided by Visual Studio, such as breakpoints, watch windows, and the call stack, to:

- **Locate Bugs:** Identify the source of errors by tracing the program's execution flow.
- **Inspect Variables:** Examine the values of variables and objects at runtime to understand their state.
- **Step Through Code:** Execute the program step by step to pinpoint the exact location of bugs. By thoroughly testing and debugging our game, we'll ensure a polished and stable final product that provides an enjoyable gaming experience to players.

## Step 8: Deployment and Distribution

Congratulations on completing the development of your SpaceShip game! Now, it's time to deploy and distribute your game so that others can enjoy playing it.

### Deployment

Deployment involves preparing your game for release by packaging it into a format that can be easily distributed and installed on users' devices. Here's how you can deploy your game:

- **Build Solution:** In Visual Studio, build your game solution to ensure it compiles without errors.
